# Hi, I’m Gauri 👋

I’m a B.Tech Computer Science student exploring the world of full-stack development through the MERN stack. I enjoy building simple, functional, and scalable web applications with a strong focus on clarity, performance, and user experience.

I believe real skills are built through consistency, curiosity, and practice — not by chasing uniqueness or trends. Every project I work on is another step toward becoming a stronger problem solver and a more thoughtful developer.

Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my core fundamentals, building meaningful projects, and learning how to design systems that are both efficient and elegant.
